  Welcome to tabreturn.com -- a web portfolio of Tristan's work.
  </p>
  <p>
  I got into making things for the Web in the days of PlayStation 1, grunge 
  music, and dial-up modems. Since then, I've worked on a diverse range of 
  digital projects, including web campaigns for clients such as Samsung, BMW, 
  and Mercedes-Benz. More recently, I've spent time in tech startups and
  academia.
  </p>
  <p>
  Along the way, I've developed from a designer into an accomplished coder -- 
  obtaining degrees in design and computer science in the process. I'm 
  currently involved in work that combines the creative, experimental, and 
  practical applications of interactive technology, including inter- and 
  trans-disciplinary projects that blend computing, design, and art to create 
  new digital experiences for web, mobile, game, and immersive media.
  </p>
  <p>
  I currently reside in <s>Wellington, New Zealand</s> Sydney, Australia.
