  Welcome to tabreturn.com -- a web portfolio of Tristan's work.
  </p>
  <p>
  I kicked-off my web design career back in the days of PlayStation 1, grunge
  music, and dial-up modems. Since then, I've worked on a diverse range of
  digital projects, including web campaigns for clients such as Samsung, BMW,
  and Mercedes-Benz. More recently, I spent some time in the tech startup
  space.
  </p>
  <p>
  Along the way I've developed into an accomplished coder and designer --
  obtaining degrees in design and computer science -- and am currently involved
  in lecturing, research, and work that blends code, interaction, interface
  design, and creativity.
  </p>

  I currently reside in Wellington, New Zealand. You can contact me via email:
