  Welcome to tabreturn.com -- a web portfolio of my work.
  </p>
  <p>
  I started making things for the Web back in the days of PlayStation 1, grunge 
  music, and dial-up modems. Over time, I evolved from designer to developer, 
  earning degrees in both creative and technical disciplines along the way. 
  Today, my work lives at the intersection of creativity, code, and 
  experimentation -- exploring interactive technology across web, mobile, games, 
  and immersive media.
  </p>
  <p>
  I currently reside in <s>Wellington, New Zealand</s> Sydney, Australia.
  You can contact me via email:
